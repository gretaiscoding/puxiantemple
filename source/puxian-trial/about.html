      <h1>How It Started</h1>
      <h2>
        The smallest Buddhist temple in the world was founded in August 1975 ,
        known as the Gem of the Buddha Temple ( Fo Pow Meow) and later being
        renamed to Puxian Temple for Samantabhadra Vihara.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Many years back, the founding leader of Pu Xian Temple formerly know as
        gem of the Buddha Temple (FO POW MEOW), Bro. Tan Kooi Beng led the
        youngest independent, non-sectarian Buddhist organisation in Malaysia.
        He started to spread Buddhism at his age of 15 to some local boys and
        girls in his village. By collecting TEN cents each from them, he managed
        to gather a total of twenty-seven Malaysian ringgit as an activity fund.

        Pu Xian Temple, a young and independent organization, faced financial
        challenges in its early days. They raised 1,200 Malaysian Ringgit by
        selling bookmarks, enough to build only four pillars. To fund their
        expansion, members took on odd jobs, provided boating services, and ran
        bicycle parks, contributing all earnings to the project. It took four
        months to complete a four-foot-high wall due to financial constraints.
        <br />
        After a year of struggling, generous donations from philanthropist Datuk
        Low Hooi Siah made the temple's expansion possible. Today, it proudly
        stands in the Jelutong district. The young leaders of Pu Xian Temple,
        despite minimal public help, showed determination and resilience in
        their efforts, making it the world's smallest Buddhist Temple and the
        youngest registered Buddhist organization in Malaysia.
